# Home-Values
# The purpose of this project is to find the most suitable model for predicting the housing price. Based on the data analysis of SAS EM, I used about a dozen different models to predict the housing price. Finally, I found that the neural network model was the most accurate model for predicting the price, and I interpreted the model at the end.#
